# Fourth Assignment: Late Binding

## Purpose
The purpose of this assignment is to exhort you to reflect on *Late Binding*.

## Problem
In a service oriented architecture (SOA), services are somehow available in a registry (e.g., [the yellow pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_pages)).
Your job is to find mechanism to find the correct desired service (when things can change).

Hints: Think of your functional description in the second assignment or the STM32 IoT node, which offers temperature and LED services.

## Form
On a half a page, describe the mechanism you invented to find the correct desired service.
