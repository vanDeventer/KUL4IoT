# Third Assignment: Service Matching

## Purpose
The purpose of this exercise is to establish a base of all possible combination of matching services between providers and consumers.
It might seem silly but the pattern occurs often.
One also reflects on the different ways to represent these combinations.

## Problem
Considering only the application layer, combine all possible "formats" and protocols in the two given sets:
1. {html, xml, json},
2. {http, coap, mqtt}.

If you find the exercise too silly, you are welcome to consider additional TCP layers.

## Form
Report in either a drawing, text, math equation or computer algorithm, the different possible combinations.
This should be uploaded in Canvas either as a JPEG or PDF.
