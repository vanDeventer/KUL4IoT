# Prelude
The aim of this course is to prepare you to better formulate a tender for an Internet of Things solution for your business or activity in your business.
The course is not to turn you into a computer scientist, but rather to find the right one and communicate with her/him.

You will therefore have to reflect on what you are doing at work and formulate a set of specifications for an IoT solution, which is how you will be assessed in this course.

To get there we will alternate between theory and practice.

The theory sections are presenting concept that we try to apply to  some practice exercises.

With the practice part, you will be measuring different entities and transmitting the information in different forms.
This is to show that it is not so hard that you can do it and yet quite complex that you need to be clear to express yourselves correctly to ask for what you really need.

Every week, a live Q&A session is there to answer any question or issue encountered in theory or practice.
